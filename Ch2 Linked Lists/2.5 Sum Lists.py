# YOu have two numbers represeneted by a linked list, weher aech node conains a single digit. 
# The digits are stored in reverse order, such that the 1's digit is at the head of the list.
# Write a funciton that adds the two numbers and returns the suma s a linked list. 
# Note:
# You are not allowed to 'cheat' and just convert the linked list to an integer

# Example:
# input: (7 -> 1 -> 6) + (5 -> 9 -> 2). That is, 617 + 295.
# output: 2 -> 1 -> 9. That is 912.

# Follow up:
# - suppose the digits are stored in forward order. Repeat the above problem. 

# Example:
# input: (6 -> 1 -> 7) + (2 -> 9 -> 5). That is, 617 + 295
# output: 9 -> 1 -> 2. That is, 912.
